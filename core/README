GHydraulics is a Quantum GIS plugin.

GHydraulics is available from http://epanet.de/ghydraulics

Quantum GIS is available from http://www.qgis.org

Functionality: The plugin will calculate economic pipe diameters for water
supply networks based on a flow rate.

A commandline interface (economicdiameter.py) is available as well as a
Quantum GIS menu and toolbar button.

Installation

The installation can be installed using the Windows installer or through the
Quantum GIS PluginInstaller available from http://spatialserver.net:3001

In case the installer is not detecting the Quantum GIS installation directory
correctly, you can use the /D option of the installer. E.g.:

ghydraulics-setup-2.0.0.exe /D=c:\Quantum GIS\python\plugins

if Quantum GIS is installed in c:\Quantum GIS

Installation from the source tarball is also possible.

Advanced Users 

The following assumes that Quantum GIS is installed in
 c:\Program Files\Quantum GIS. If this is not the case, the instructions
have to be adjusted accordingly.

c:\Program Files\Quantum GIS\python needs to be in the PYTHONPATH:

set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;c:\Program Files\Quantum GIS\python

c:\Program Files\Quantum GIS needs to be in the PATH:

PATH=%PATH%;c:\Program Files\Quantum GIS

The script economicdiameter.py will fill the DIAMETER field with the economic
diameter according to the RESULT_FLO field value.

RESULT_FLO values are expected to be flow rates in l/s.
The economic diameters are nominal diameters (DN) in mm.

The script will work for diameters from DN 80 to DN 1000

A diameter of 9999 will be used to indicate where the RESULT_FLO flowrate exceeds
the economic flowrate of DN 1000.
